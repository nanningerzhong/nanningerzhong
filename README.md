# The Post for He Haibin

暴风雨结束后，你不会记得自己是怎样活下来的，你甚至不确定暴风雨真的结束了。
但有一件事是确定的：当你穿过了暴风雨， 你早已不再是原来那个人。
                                                      ——村上春树《海边的卡夫卡》

And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.
                                                      ——Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore

我想了很久，这个页面应该叫什么题目。我想不出来。
二中贴吧修改我的留言，封禁我的帖子。而我所想谈论的事情又与贴吧中的何海彬专帖（https://tieba.baidu.com/p/427650826）紧密相关。
那我就在一个可以自由表达，且永远可以被留在这个世界的地方写下属于我声音。
并且，或许，取一个和贴吧帖子一样的镜像名字最符合这个此刻的意境。

I've been thinking for a long time about how to name this page, but I can't come up with anything.
My posts were modified and banned by the administrators of Er Zhong Tieba, yet what I want to discuss is closely related to The Post for He Haibin (https://tieba.baidu.com/p/427650826).
So, I decided to write down my thoughts in a place where I can express myself freely and where my words can always remain in this world forever.
Perhaps, adopting a mirror name similar to the  post is most apt.

我就先再此挖个坑，容我以后慢慢来填写。我前两年写的一些零碎的，情绪化的内容在可以在豆瓣生活组找到。
而这里，我希望能把整个事情以一种更有逻辑，更有启发，更有意义的方式去书写这件事情。

I create this page here, and please allow me to fill it in later gradually. The fragmented and emotional pieces I've written over the past few years can be found in the Douban. Here, however, I hope to articulate the entire matter in a more logical, insightful, and meaningful way.
